<meta name="description" content="Being smart with packing is key to enjoying a trip, be it 3 days, 3 weeks or 3 months long.
Limit yourself to one bag, preferably a backpack if you&rsquo;re going to be walking and moving around a lot.
Why pack light? From the onebag.com page:

Security – you can always keep your single bag on you
Economy – no need to check luggage or pay for transport for walkable distances
Mobility – you&rsquo;re never held back by heavy luggage
Serenity – less stuff to lose, easy to pack and unpack

Minimum viable packing list
Here follows a very minimal packing list. In general you don&rsquo;t need more than this, but you should of course adjust for climate, comfort, and niche needs. So if you&rsquo;re going to a beach town obviously also pack swimwear, duh (or better yet, find shorts that double as swimwear). If you&rsquo;re a photographer bring your camera. And so on." />

<h3 id="clothing-wear-one-item-from-each-bullet-point">Clothing (wear one item from each bullet point):</h3>
<ul>
<li>3 x Shirts</li>
<li>3 x Underwear</li>
<li>3 x Socks</li>
<li>1 x Pants</li>
<li>1 x Shoes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="technology--entertainment">Technology &amp; Entertainment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Phone – for GPS, ongoing trip planning and connecting with people you meet</li>
<li>Book or E-reader – good for long transports</li>
<li>Necessary chargers</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="documents">Documents</h3>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Dry bag or sink stopper – see the laundry section below</li>
<li>Toothbrush</li>
</ul>
<p>Toothpaste, soap and other hygiene articles can be bought at the destination or brought with you, it&rsquo;s up to you.</p>
<h3 id="how-big-a-backpack-do-i-need">How big a backpack do I need?</h3>
<p>For the above list, no more than 15L.</p>
<h3 id="laundry">Laundry</h3>
<p>The dead simple way to clean is to use a dry bag, 5-10L in size. You simply pour some shampoo or shower gel into it, then some hot/warm water until it lathers, put clothes inside, shake around, let sit for 10 minutes or more if really dirty. Empty and rinse in the shower or sink. Usually underwear and socks are easier to wash by hand directly, and then you don&rsquo;t need more than a 5L dry bag. Don&rsquo;t worry, this method does in fact clean your clothes very well.</p>
