<meta name="description" content="Here are some self audit stuff you can do around your home easily.
Summary:

Avoid chemicals
Avoid radiation

Long version:
Wifi - EMF

Use shielded ethernet cable like this one Once you do this, it is best to turn off Wi-Fi in your modem.
Have proper grounding, if you do not have call a good electirician.
Keyboard/Mouse: Best to use and old vintage ball wired mouse. For keyboard have a nice simple wired keyboard few inches away from your laptop.
Turn off Wi-Fi before bed, it is best to use timer plug as well.

Clothing

Only wear organic cotton shirt. This one is really simple and good quality. Generally I buy in bulk from here.
Blue light blocking glasses can be nice if you spend so much time in front of screen.
Organic cotton bedsheets
In kitchen only use steel, ceramic and cast iron. Nothing else.

Cleaning

Only thing you will ever need is vinegar and hot water. You can clean yourself, your hands, dishes and everything.
But if you really would love some soap, you can have pure olive oil soap like this.

Plants

Bamboo Palm
Chinese Evergreen
English Ivy
Gerbara Daisy
