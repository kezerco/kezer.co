  <p>I was a hard windows / mac user.
Windows for daily stuff, work and gaming, mac for travelling, graphics work and unreal engine.</p>
<p>And my wife also had <em>2015macbook pro</em>. Just recently it got extremely slow, I mean I remember what it was to use that computer, it was booting up fast, opening pdfs, videos fast, it was fast. But now booting takes ages, cannot open big pdf files, something got wrong. I formatted it couple of times, installed old OS versions, nothing has changed. Apple knows it better to slow their computer to sell you newer.</p>
<p>Then I got into investigating, lets say your wifi card broken, then you go to Apple, they give you 2 options:</p>
<ul>
<li>mainboard has to be replaced, <strong>1000 USD</strong></li>
<li>or get a new one, <strong>1200 USD</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>and of course you choose new one. But WTF, just for a wifi card, you bought a new computer! This is ridiculous, and I am not even talking about the privacy problems.</p>
<p>Then I got my hands on a <strong>Thinkpad x230</strong>, the last bastion, you can change components, install linux without any hassle, perfect!</p>
<p>Then tried tons of distros and finally found my true love, <a href="https://artixlinux.org/">Artix Linux</a> which basically Arch without <em>systemd</em>. I use it with <strong>runit</strong>, but there are options for openrc and s6 as well.</p>
<h4 id="lets-dive-in">Lets dive in:</h4>
<p>You can find base ISO from its <a href="https://artixlinux.org/download.php">website</a> the base will be enough.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI3bGeT31Bo">this</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqUP1juP4qM">this</a> videos will be enough to cover everything. Especially installing on encrypted disk.</p>
<p>Then simple install <a href="https://larbs.xyz">LARBS</a>. It is basically ready-made system with <a href="https://suckless.org/">suckless</a> software. In around 10 minutes you will have <em>stable, extremely useful, ready to work</em> <strong>Artix build</strong>.</p>
<p>Then the <strong>only tip</strong> I will give about Artix, is to use it. In a week you will be sufficient enough to work faster than ever.</p>
